# Simple-Palpatine
A simple lua script to go with the [Secret Palpatine](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597522954) [Tabletop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/) game.

Tells players the information they need to know before the game starts because who trusts their friends?

To use this script yourself, open [Secret Palpatine](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597522954) in [Tabletop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/) and add an object to the table (eg. a red block).
Then save the game, **then re-load the game you just saved** (do not forget this step).

Right click on the object you created and copy the GUID from scripting. Replace the button_GUID value with your GUID in Global.lua.

Finally click modding, scripting and paste in the contents of Global.lua!
